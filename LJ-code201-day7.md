##LJ Code 201 Day 7

Today I feel like I really struggled a lot, but I also learned a lot. To begin, I created a plan during lab time for how I was going to approach the project, highlighting the different components of the assignment, and though I struggled a lot, this served as a nice infrastructure for me to go off of. In lab I worked to get the totals displaying on my lists from yesterday, and then I moved on to the today's assignment. I had little trouble crafting my constructor beyond some smaller tweaks that had to be made. Again, I really reviewed the process of moving an element to the dom from JavaScript: 1. select a target element, 2. create new element, 3. fill new element with data, 4. append new element to target. I think this is what I took away from the day more than anything else: an appreciation for the importance of this process. In all, it was a challenging day full thinking hard, but I think it was a very beneficial day as well.

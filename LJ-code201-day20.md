#LJ Code 201 Day 20 

Today was our last day of class. We  sat in on the IOS presentations, which were rather eye-opening. Watching one presentation and then another, seeing an app that tells you where to get a beer, another that links up to a light and generates different hues of light at specific time intervals, or still another that involved usig emojis for interval training, caused me to realize the incredible amount of creativity that goes into the making of apps, something I had not thought about before. There is a great capacity to create that comes with the IOS training, and I think I might like to one day receive that training. Still, even when I reflect on how far we have come as a cohort in the last month, going from making about me pages to buliding fully functional websites, it truly is a staggering thing. We have come far, learned a lot, and achieved even more. I feel a sense of gratitude for all that I have had had the chance to learn, and it makes me wonder how much more so I will grow as a developer after having taken 301.

##LJ Code 201 Day 5

We learned a lot about GitHub today. It was good to hear how important it is to type "git status" frequently, for that had become a practice of mine. I had a fair amount of trouble during the lab, getting bogged down in the code and even making some mistakes with branching and merging. Fortunately, after a restful night's sleep I think I am starting to understand and appreciate the significance of branching on a deeper level. 

A helpful graphic that was drawn showed the hierarchy of declaring global variables, declaring functions, and invoking functions. I thouhght this was a helpful way to coneceptualize the way in which we organize code. Also helpful to learn about was the importance of indentation in HTML and striving for human readability. I had some trouble with indentation of my HTML for the "About Me" assignment, but I was able to go back and fix it pretty well. 

We learned some interesting information about CSS, such as writing div, h1, body, html, p{} saves writing the same code five times. It is also important to start less explicit and get more explicit. I feel confident using ID, class and element selectors. I also feel confident with content, padding, border, and margin. What I feel less confident about is floating as well as absolute versus relative positioning. I plan to keep reading about these until they make sense to me. 

All in all, it was a long week filled to the brim with content, but I have faith that more of it is sticking with me than not.

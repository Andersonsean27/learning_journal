##LJ Code 201 Day 11

What a day. We spent a good chunk of lab time simply working on building things, and it was a frustrating time for me. I feel like, conceptually, I am really understanding the intricacies of JavaScript, but that understanding is not translating to me me being better at writing code. During the lab, I made out a detailed plan about what I was going to do, breaking larger goals into smaller, more manageable pieces. In my thinking, I could improve upon my ability to reduce goals even further. Despite having a plan, I was struggling, not knowing what to do, needing help, trying out things and having them not work. Later in the night I worked on the assignment further, and I spent an hour without making any tangible progress. It was a frustrating day, but my hope is to come in tomorrow reenergized, prepared to learn, and ready to make the changes that I need to make to improve my project.

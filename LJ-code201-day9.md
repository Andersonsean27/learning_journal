##LJ Code 201 Day 9

Today was a nice day to dabble in CSS. As I have previously heard it stated, CSS is an exercise in trial and error, a hacky language, and that definitely was my experience with it today. I spent a long time in lab working on things like positioning and display. Relative position is my favorite, because I feel like it gives me a lot of flexibility with what I do. I became better aquainted with inspecting elements right in the browser, hovering over elements with my mouse carefully to examine the dimmensions and other qualities of an element, comparing it back to my code. I experimented with writing code directly into the browser, and then transposing it back to my actual code. 

The truth is this has been a challenging week for me. Particularly with the JavaScript we have been learning, I am waiting for an "Ah-ha!" moment to arrive, a series of revelations that will find me integrating and more deeply comprehending all the knowledge that has been given to me these past two weeks. Unfortunately, this moment has not come yet, but I was told that it would come, and that I just need to stick to the course and continue to apply myself, and that is precisely what I plan to do.

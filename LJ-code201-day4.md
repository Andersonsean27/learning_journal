#LJ Code 201 Day 4

I thought it was helpful to hear that a good guideline when testing that something works in JavaScript is to check for what happens with no input, 1 piece of input, and infinite input. A phrase that is sticking in my mind is that we want to build things that are robust. This really captured for me the beauty of JavaScript. 

It will be important, I think, for me to bear in mind the idea that everything in CSS is a box. It was helpful to learn about border, padding, and margin, in addition to the distinction between block-level and inline elements. My mind is still a bit fuzzy with regards to relative versus absolute positioning, but I wrote down the t-shirt diagram and I plan to study it carefully. 

Sam mentioned that it was easy for functions to become complicated, and I definitely agree. It was nice to simply approach them as being wrappers around code that does something. This really served to bring things back down to the basic level. 

I had a very positive experience in my pair coding. I got along well with David and it seemed like we worked quickly and smoothly through the assignment. It was cool to see how coding can take on a more social dynamic. I learned more about how JavaScript works both from being the navigator as well as the driver, but I definitly enjoyed being the driver more because it allowed me to use the keyboard. Forking, cloning, merging, and pulling a repo was an interesting, if slightly challenging experience. Then again, I did have a diagram written down that helped me in the process.

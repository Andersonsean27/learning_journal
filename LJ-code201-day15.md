#LJ Code 201 Day 15

It was the first day of working in our groups, and I think I am learning a lot. To begin, it is really, really important when working in a group, and also really diffifcult, to communicate openly about what, exactly, it is that you want to create. People see a project differently, possessing different perspectives on what exactly a project is going to look like, and it is during this open communication that differences in perception become manifest. Further, it is important to remain organized. We spent a while on the white board, mapping out the project, trying to figure out where to begin from. Creating a sense of the problem domain, the goals of what a project will do and not do, is all a part of the process. It is important to be open during this communication, to accept the ideas of others while also being unafraid to voice your own ideas. Once a sense of the vision for a project has been established, it is then time to begin to divide up the work. What I have learned is that generally if everyone is open about what they are working on then there will be no problems with confusion or miscommunication.

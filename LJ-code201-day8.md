## LJ Code 201 Day 8

Today was another day full of learning. It was helpful to learn that a good way to structure the JavaScript for Tuesday is to go as following :
global data,
rand number function,
constructor,
create instances,
var for dom,
function for header,
function for footer,
function that calls each location render, and
calls.
This is helping me get a better and better sense of how to organize my code, and more importantly how to streamline it. We learned that events are things that happen in the browser, and though I experienced putting an event into my code, I think it will be good to review this topic and explore it more, for it is certainly a deep topic. In the lab my partner and I drew a pictue of what we were building was going to look like, and that was helpful. I really enjoy pair programming. My partner was able to help me fill in gaps in understanding, and having two pairs of eye of the code ensured that there were less errors. Looking over and reflecting on the code we have built, it seems like we are really starting to build some sophisticated things, though I know in actuality we are only getting started!

#LJ Code 201 Day 16

Today was technically our first full day of working together in our project group, and a productive day it was. I spent the morning working with Doug, and I learned more about the intricacies of implementing local storage into programming. I realized once more throughout the day that it is really important to communicate and be open when using git hub, in order to avoid any git situations. We were quite succsessful to this point. I later worked with Dylan on creating a button for the site, and I didn't really learn much from the experience, but it was still valuable. We had our first stand-up meeting, and it was a neat experience to be able to dialogue about the progress that we made on the project over the weekend. I am realizing more and more the importance that communcation plays in a team programming environment. Later on in the day we had another stand-up, and I think it was equally beneficial for us to check in before getting to work for the afternoon. I did some styling work on the site and Kaylyn gave me some useful pointers on using CSS. It was great to learn from her.

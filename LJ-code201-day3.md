#LJ Code 201 - Day 3
Today we learned a lot. First, we spent a good amount of time with git, working to git init on the terminal, create a GH repo, pull a GH link, and then push what we have back to GH. The truth is I am still working to wrap my mind around the concept of Github. However, I am feeling more and more comfortable with the terminal, and in fact I am even preferring it to using the finder! 

We learned about control flow, and the distinction between statements and expressions was helpful. We learned about naming variables, and the difference between rules and guidelines. We also spent some time working with arrays. Then, we learned about loops, which would prove to be helfpul to know about during the lab. 

During the lab, I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to structure the additional questions. I was pretty succsessful at this, relying mainly on for loops. What I struggled with was creating a counter to track the correct and incorrect answers to my quiz. It took me a while to realize that I could declare a variable that functioned as a counter, and increment it each time a correct response was given by the user. Already I am seeing how JavaScript has increasingly intricate layers to it. Next, I proceeded to work on adding content to my page, which went fine, and I spent some time with CSS. I understand why CSS can be frustrating. The truth is I am still trying to figure out how to best format the presenation of my page, but I think I will be able to figure it out tonight. Right now I am struggling with some extra white space that is showing up on some of my div's.

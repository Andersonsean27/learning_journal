# LJ Code 201 Day 19

Today was our last full day together working on our project. As we came together to plan and rehearse our presentation, it was challenging to know where to begin, how to approach the presentation, how to divide out who says what. In the end, it was the intersection of making a plan with spontaneously going for it that led to the making of our plan. Initially, we planned out the presentation, dividing it into chunks, but then as we rehearsed, we allowed ourselves to mess up and fumble on our words, having faith that exploring the content would lead us towards knowing what to say and being able to say it better. Like playing in a sand box, I tried out saying things different ways, simply exploring and experimenting, and this led to me figuring out my lines. It was a fun time. We were a supportive community to each other. If someone felt nervous or made a mistake, we told them to just go for it, that they were doing great, and this led to us feeling more comfortable rehearsing, and it also increased the quality of our presentation. I am looking forward to the presentation tomorrow, and I am thankful for all the experiences that have led up to it.
